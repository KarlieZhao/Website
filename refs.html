<font face=Verdana size=2>
<span> <b>Who qualifies for a reference from me?</b> </span><p>
The following may roughly be used to determine whether one qualifies
for a reference letter. Those who score at least two
points with the following scoring system:
<ul>
<li> +1 for each course taken from me
<li> +1 for doing their final year project under my supervision
<li> +1 per year for graduate studies under my supervision
</ul>
Exceptions to these rule may be granted in the case that you have done <i> exceptionally</i> well in one of the activities listed...
<p>
<br>
<font face=Verdana size=2>
<em>Please do not ask me for a reference letter after only one class!</em>
<p>
<br>
<font face=Verdana size=2>
<b>I meet the requirements, should I ask for a letter?</b>
<font face=Verdana size=2>
<p >DO NOT ASK ME FOR A REFERENCE LETTER IF...</p>
<ul>
<li>you often talk in class or use your phone when you should be listening</li>
<li>you are often absent or late, without documented reasons</li>
<li>you do not participate regularly in class</li>
<li>you fail to submit assignments or submit them late</li>
<li>you write careless email messages without a greeting or signature (eg. &#8220;i wasnt in class today did I miss anything&#8221;)</li>
<li>you are not an engaged, attentive student who tries hard, is polite and treats the people around you with consideration
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p>I AM HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A REFERENCE LETTER IF...</p>
<ul>
<li>you are always attentive in class, with your phone off and your ears open</li>
<li>you attend class and are punctual, with very occasional exceptions</li>
<li>you ask questions when you don&#8217;t understand things</li>
<li>you always do your work and make an effort to respond to questions about it, whether or not you &#8220;get it right&#8221;</li>
<li>you come to me for extra help when you need it, or you seek help from the TA</li>
<li>you inform me in advance when you know you will miss a class or be late, and you make an effort to catch up on what you miss</li>
<li>you are an engaged, attentive student who tries hard, is polite and treats the people around you with consideration.
     When writing you a reference letter, I do not care about your grades.  I care about how hard you try and how much you learn.</li>
