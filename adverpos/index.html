            <p>
            There was a time, however brief, when the web was a space almost entirely free of
            commerce and capitalism. Today, however, our every online action is tracked by
            sophisticated automated systems (“robots”) which mine our most personal data to analyze,
            predict, and finally, determine our behavior. While this vast surveillance architecture has
            indeed been used by governments as a means of control, its unchecked growth is due
            largely to corporations whose only motivation is profit. Human users are rarely asked to
            consent to such tracking, but must instead accept it as the necessary cost of access for the
            “free” information and services we feel unable to live without.</p>
            <p>
            The works in this exhibition also begin with “robots”, though with a different agenda. Rather
            than tracking humans, these robots are trained to search the web as if they were human,
            following specific user profiles they have been assigned (age, gender, location, interests
            and the like). Each trained robot is then turned loose on the web, driving a modified version
            of the Chrome browser, to periodically visit websites that it “likes”, and to click on weblinks it
            chooses, which then bring it to still further websites. This process continues over several
            weeks, during which time the robot collects and saves each of the advertisements (ads) it
            has been targeted with (generally several thousand or more). The specific ads shown are
            determined by real-time auctions, generally occurring within the time it takes a page to load,
            in which the robot's growing data profile is sold to the highest corporate bidder, who then
            injects one or more ads into the page content. The robot, rather than using these ads to
            make purchases, instead uses each as the texture for a single polygon on its virtual mesh
            body. The training period concludes when the robot’s new skin, which you see here for the
            first time, is complete.</p>

            <b>Portraiture for the blemished flesh of browsing beings.</b>
            <q>Advertising Positions by Daniel C. Howe is a fully-articulated conceptual art intervention with an aesthetic outcome (glossy luminous and radiant rendered portraits to satisfy the narcissistic instincts of the commodified psychometric market) that at the same time operates as an engaged computationally-sophisticated (programmatic generative bot-art) and polemical intervention against the ubiquitous networked advertising that permeates and ideologically colonizes cognitive space with visual trash: portraiture for the blemished flesh of browsing beings.</q>
