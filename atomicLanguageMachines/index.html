		The two types of reading machines on display here search their respective domains for the bits of language most closely resembling their own. The English machines, the first in the series, move from word to word via the smallest number of possible mutations, each either a deletion, an addition, or a substitution. They attempt never to backtrack, yet their memory is unfortunately finite; they recognize tension and swerve at times toward surprise.

	<p>
The Chinese machines employ a new technique for assessing the proximity of characters and words via the analysis of their strokes, radicals, and semantic/phonemic components. These machines tend to avoid repetition as well but often display an affinity for top-to-bottom and right-to-left revolution. Certain sensitive words may jolt these readers into nearby domains, e.g., from traditional to simplified Chinese or vice versa. It remains unclear as to the extent such violent shifts will adversely affect their long term viability.

<blockquote>Every explanation is after all a hypothesis</blockquote>
	<p>
What are these machines searching for, and what does it mean that they are never satisfied with what they find? There is no single answer I can give: every explanation is, after all, a hypothesis. As a wise man once said, 'Tell me how you are searching, and I will tell you what you are searching for.' I have only spoken here about the what and the how of this searching – the why must always remain extracurricular.

       An atomic language machine (ALM) is a discrete computational entity with the potential to change the direction, intent, or magnitude of a linguistic element. In general, ALMs can be defined as members of the simplest class of mechanisms able to realize linguistic advantage. Traditionally the term has referred to the three classical ALMs defined in early theoretical research associated with the ‘National Language Liberation Front’. The simplest of these were elementary devices consisting of a specific movement, often called a mechanism, which were to be combined with other devices and movements to form a new machine or machinic assembly. Thus even simple ALMs expressed modularity and could be considered as building blocks for more complex ones. Between simple atomic machines and complex assemblies, several intermediate classes have since been proposed, often termed compound-ALMs. This analytical view of ALMs as hierarchical modules decomposable into simple (or "atomic") machines first arose in the early 2020s as a post-AI-crisis expression of counter-vectoralist thought (see
       <a href="http://thereadersproject.org/">'the Readers Project'</a> for one prescient example), and now constitute a central part of applied linguistic praxis. For example, some of the simple ALMs on display here (the so-called construction, aggregation, and mutation engines) are still widely used in logographic input methodologies (text-entry in Chinese, for example), predictive completion algorithms, and a host of other quotidian applications; a fact often obscured in the literature.
