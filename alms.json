  "longdesc": "An atomic language machine (ALM) is a discrete computational entity with the potential to change the direction, intent, or magnitude of a linguistic element. An ALM can be defined as members of the simplest class of mechanisms able to realize linguistic advantage. Traditionally the term has referred to the three classical ALMs defined in early theoretical research associated with the ‘National Language Liberation Front’. The simplest of these were elementary devices consisting of a specific movement, often called a mechanism, which were to be combined with other devices and movements to form a new machine or machinic assembly. Thus even simple ALMs expressed modularity and could be considered as building blocks for more complex ones. ",
  "part2":"Between simple atomic machines and complex assemblies, several intermediate classes have since been proposed, often termed compound-ALMs. This analytical view of ALMs as hierarchical modules decomposable into simple (or ///\"atomic\") machines first arose in the early 2020s as a post-AI-crisis expression of counter-vectoralist thought (see 'the Readers Project' for one prescient example), and now constitute a central part of applied linguistic praxis. For example, some of the simple ALMs on display here (the so-called construction, aggregation, and mutation engines) are still widely used in logographic input methodologies (text-entry in Chinese, for example), predictive completion algorithms, and a host of other quotidian applications; a fact often obscured in the literature.",
