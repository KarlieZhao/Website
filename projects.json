This process continues over several weeks, during which the robot collects, as it has been trained to do, all of the advertisements it is served based on its profile (generally several thousand or more), applying each to a single polygon on the mesh skin of the virtual avatar it inhabits. The training period concludes when the robot’s 3-dimensional figure is complete.",

The project was recently presented at Eyebeam, MIT, and the New School, covered by Wired magazine, and featured at Transmediale in Berlin. <br><br />AdNauseam developed from an earlier project entitled TrackMeNot, which similarly protected users from data profiling by issuing generated decoy queries to search engines.
