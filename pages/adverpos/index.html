    <p>There was a time, however brief, when the web was a space free of commerce and capitalism. Today, however,
      our every online action is tracked by sophisticated automated systems ("robots") that mine our most personal
      data to analyze, predict, and finally, determine our behavior. While this vast surveillance architecture has
      indeed been used by governments as a means of control, its unchecked growth is due largely to corporations
      motivated by profit. Human users are rarely asked to consent, but must instead accept tracking
      as the necessary cost of access to the “free” information we can no longer live without.</p>

    <p>The works in this exhibition also begin with “robots”, though with a different agenda. Rather than tracking
      humans, these robots are trained to search the web <i>as if</i> they were human, following specific user-profiles
      they are assigned (age, gender, location, interests, etc). Each trained robot is released on the web, driving a
      modified version of the Chrome browser, to periodically visit sites that it “likes”, and to click on links it
      chooses, which then bring it to still further sites. This process continues over several weeks, during which
      time the robot collects and saves each of the ads with which it has been targeted (generally several thousand or more).
      The specific ads shown are determined by real-time auctions, which occur within the time it takes the page to load,
      in which the robot's growing data profile is sold to the highest corporate bidder, who then injects one or more ads
      into the page content. The robot, rather than using these ads to make purchases, instead uses each as the texture
      for a single polygon on its virtual mesh body. The training period concludes when the robot’s new skin, which you
      can see here for the first time, is complete.</p>
